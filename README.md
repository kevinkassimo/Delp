# Delp

This is a Chrome extension project for Hack on the Hill 2 @UCLA.

Team members: Qianmeng Chen, Yizhu Zhang, Pei Zhou, Kevin Qian



Description:

We created a Chrome Extension called "Delp" that enables UCLA students to rate each dish in the UCLA dining menu website: http://menu.dining.ucla.edu/Menus. This will help students make better and faster decisions regarding to which dining hall to go. It can also motive dining halls to improve the quality of dishes that are downvoted and provide more often the dishes that are upvoted.

We added two buttons after each dish in the menu: one upvote and one downvote, and appended the number of upvotes and downvotes by former students. You can only upvote or downvote a dish once, and we will store the vote into the database server and update the vote counts immediately.

This project was mostly built with Javascript, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and JQuery.
